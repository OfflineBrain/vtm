# Overview
Character creation is a starting point of introduction of a character to the game. It can be player's character or an NPC for storyteller.
During character creation player should decide its story (Clan, Background, Nature), Attributes, Abilities, Flaws and so on. Most of values are limited in their values and it depends on story timeline (Dark Age, Victorian Age, Modern Nights), Clan and/or other decisions made by players.
Characters created by storyteller doesn't have most of those limitations, as well as limitations on character race (Vampire, Ghoul, Human, Werewolf, etc.)

# Player's Character
First, player should choose their Clan, Bloodline and Generation. Bloodlines are different for each Clan.
Each vampire is cursed and this curse is inheritance of their Bloodline, sometimes blood is cursed multiple different ways, but only one Curse has effect on the creature.
Player also comes up with character's concept and chooses its Nature and Demeanor. 

Then player has to decide numeric values for character's characteristics:
- Attributes - Primary, Secondary and Tertiary 
- Abilities - Primary, Secondary and Tertiary
- Virtues - Self-control, Conscience, Courage
- Merits and Flaws
- Disciplines

After setting all values, player able to spend Free Points to adjust characteristics further.

# Story Character
Storyteller can create characters more freely. First choose the race, choose Clan and Bloodline and other selectable parameters if it's a vampire.
Numeric values could be set without restrictions to fit the story.
